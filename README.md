# Analysis of haiku from the Philadelphia Reflections website

The [Philadelphia Reflections website](http://www.philadelphia-reflections.com) contains several hundred haiku. This analysis shows how these haiku can be clustered (categorized) based on the apparent significance of the word usage in each haiku, compared to the overall word usage in the group of haiku as a whole.

The text files are contained in **corpus_haiku.zip**
